# College Dropout Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing student dropout rates in higher education. Using a dataset containing demographic, socio-economic, and academic performance variables, we explore patterns and correlations to understand what contributes to student success or dropout.

## Dataset
The dataset (`dataset.csv`) contains numerical and categorical variables, some of which were originally mislabeled. Additional research was conducted to interpret categorical values accurately.

**Key Features:**
- Student demographics
- Academic performance metrics
- Social and economic factors
- Dropout, graduate, or enrollment status

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries.

Install dependencies using:
